# Comau SmartSix – Robotics Toolbox (Python)

A collaborative university project that:

* **Ports** the original MATLAB control scripts for the Comau SmartSix manipulator to **Python** using Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox.  
* **Simulates** trajectories and controllers in Python *and* visualises them in CoppeliaSim.  
* **Executes** the same trajectories on the real robot arm during a scheduled lab practice.  
* Ships a **Docker** image + Dev Container so every team-member works in an identical environment.  
* Tracks progress with a GitHub Project board, weekly 1-week sprints and automated CI.
